Lithium Theme Editor FAQ
========================


1. How do I import my theme to my device.

Copy the code from the textbox and save it into a .js file.
In your device, copy the file into /Library/Lithium/ folder.

2. Why are some themes prefixed with LN?

These are themes that are/will be included in the Lithium Nitro theme pack.
You can add the repo https://supermamon.github.io/repo in cydia to install it.

3. Can I use the code of this page on my own website?

Yes. You can clone the code from github. 

4. I saw the change log and I'm interested on the changes for v0.6.1 & 0.6.2.
   What are they for?

   **** v0.6.2 update temporarily disabled. ****
   
v0.6.1. I've remove the code for the samples from the main ThemeMaker.html. They 
        are now save as XML files. With that, I can load the scripts just by 
		having the XML filenames. XML format is as below:
		
		<theme>
		<name>Empty</name>
		<script>
		<![CDATA[
		(height, percentage, charging, low, color) 
		{
		
		/* code here */
		
		}
		]]>
		</script>
		</theme>		
		
		
		The 'p' parameter is to be able to 'pick' the default theme to load.
		So if the URL is called like this: 
		
		    https://.../Lithium/ThemeMaker.html?p=LBI
			
		It will select LBI by default. This is good to use when sharing scripts.
		
v0.6.2  Now you can pass the URL for your XML file with the 'x' parameter.
		https://.../Lithium/ThemeMaker.html?x=http://.../LBI.xml
